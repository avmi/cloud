# Envars CLI

`envars` is a tool to set Environment Variables using a JSON database file.

The command line tool reads `ENVARS_JSON_PATH` and sets the variables for a project whose name is equal to the current directory.

## Database of variables (e.g. envars.json)

The path of the database file must be specified by an environment variable named `ENVARS_JSON_PATH`.

```json
{
  "myapp": {
    "dev": {
      "APP_NAME": "my application ðŸ˜„",
      "EMPTY_VAR": ""
    },
    "prod": {
      "APP_NAME": "my application ðŸ˜„ [production]",
      "EMPTY_VAR": "<must-not-be-empty>"
    }
  }
}
```
